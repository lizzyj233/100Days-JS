       <p>I was on vacation sooo did not have a whole lot of time. I did squeeze in a quick sesh in xcode buidling out the simple "Light" project -- tap the button and the screen turns to black, tap again and it goes back to white. Simple but something. I'll make up for my missed hours with extra JS!</p>

       <p>I missed 1 or 2 days due to LIFE (it's not a big deal okay???) but the days i didn't miss i spent time putsying around in XCode and trying to understand the basics of running emulators, creating storyboards, and testing a basic "hello world" iOS app (no i haven't pushed this stuff to GH yet... it's a WIP). It's so neat, but super overwhelming, so imma hop back over to learning some JS the next day or two.</p>

        <p id="day3-content">I began a JS project to calculate the slope/rating for tees at a golf course which are not already rated for female golfers. This is something I was inspired to make as a female golfer who likes to play the longer tees for a challenge. Often times, these tees are not rated for female golfers so I have to manually calculate the difficulty... so I figured... why not make my life easier and turn this into a project?!? Please see my repo at <a href="https://github.com/lizzyj233/JS-Golf-Course-Calculations">GitHub</a> to see the work i'm doing on this project. I'll probably hang out here for a while because this is something I personally need as golf season is upon us! <br><br>Ideally, I'll create the JS version (yes, it needs a lot of work - those elifs are super inefficient... gotta think through a loop) and a swift version which I can load up to my phone. I'm really excited about this project and think it could be extremely useful to many female golfers who don't prefer to play the forward tees :) -- @LPGA you wanna sponsor my project :D </p>

        <p id="day3-content">I worked through a few lessons in the Apple Books "Develop with Swift Fundamentals" ebook and playgrounds for xcode. Mostly just understanding the syntax etc. of swift as well as operators and type definitions. </p>

    <p>On the days preceding the start of 100 days, I created this simple html page with styles etc. - looking sharp, imo!</p>
